ECE471 Fall 2019 -- HW7

Name: Caleb Jewell

4. Describe your something cool: Stores and prints the max and min temperatures after 15 
seconds of data taken. 

5.
   a. I say this is a hard real-time task because if the brakes do not work in time it could cost someone their life if it is an urgrent situation. I would want my anti-lock brakes to 
work everytime on time. 

   b. I think this is a soft real-time task because it is just a radio if it misses its	
deadline by a couple seconds it will not be a big deal, might cause annoyance.

   c. I also think this is a soft real-time system because at most it will cost lag if misseda deadline but will not be fatal.

   d. There is no standard and no error reporting

   e. Has a full duplex and no speed limit. 

   f. No this will not work since it is to far, spi only supports up to around 10 feet.

   g. It is not fast enough.

6.
   a. When I type in the command nothing shows, I assume this command just "cancels" the
command it is linked with.

   b. The command filled up the memory so it could not execute.
  
   c. This could be useful to initialize data storage 
  
   d. I think dev/random acts as a random number generator that you could pipe with a command
